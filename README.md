The project title is "Hiding Text Inside an Image." This project is created using the concept of steganography. It hides text inside images using steganography techniques like RGB channel manipulation and the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method. To ensure privacy, it requires a secret key for both hiding and retrieving the hidden text.
